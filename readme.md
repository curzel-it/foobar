# Google's Foobar Challenge

![Challenge accepted meme](meme.jpg "Challenge Accepted!")

## What is it?
In short, the challenge is Google's secret hiring process.<br>
Complete it, and a recruiter will likely call you to schedule an interview.<br>
The challenge is invitation-only but there is a chance you get ramdomly selected (which I was for example) based on your search history (I guess) and certain search keywords (such as `headless chrome`)

## Warnings
Don't copy solutions...<br>
Challenges are only fun if they are... challenging...
